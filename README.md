# CommonSyntax-ConsoleGuestBook
The homework from the Lesson 13, Mini-Project, of Module 2, Common Syntax, of the Complete Foundation in C# Course Series from Tim Corey. We are to build a Console Guest Book. Ask the user for their name and how many are in their party. Keep track of how many people are at the party. At the end, print out the guest list and the total number of guests.
